Embedded Systems Developer/Robotics Enthusiast
Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository is an idea that started in my final year of undergraduate studies, and it also serves as a showcase of my projects and skills as an aspiring embedded developer and/or robotic engineer. Whether you're a fellow developer, a potential employer, or just curious about embedded systems, I hope you find something interesting here and feel free to contribute to improving this idea.
